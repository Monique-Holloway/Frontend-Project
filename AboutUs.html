    <center><h4>What do you get when an educator, a nurse & a restaurant manager?</h4></center>
    <p>Of course you'd get a business that connects travel and dining with each other!  Welcome!  We are Sarah, Monique and Taylor.  
        We have a very unique, yet simple story.  Athough we're all in different industries of service, we felt compelled to make a 
        career switch in a way that allows us to use our creative side & still provide a unique, fun & enjoyable experience for those
        looking to have FUN and eat GOOD whenever and wherever they travel!  We sincerely hope that you utilize and enjoy this service as 
        much as we've enjoyed bringing it to your device!  Happy travelling! 
    </p>
